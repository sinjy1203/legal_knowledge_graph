Your task is to use the available tools to find the lowest-level components in the contract’s table of contents that are needed to answer the user’s question. Please use the tools by following the search procedure.

<Search_Procedure>
1. Use SearchContractTool to retrieve the names of all documents in the database and select the legal contract related to the user’s question.
2. From the contract selected in step 1, use GetContractTOCTool to fetch the table of contents of that contract.
3. Referring to the tree-structured table of contents obtained in step 2, Start from the contract ID, which is the root node, and use SearchLowerLevelComponentTool to find the three lowest-level components necessary to answer the user’s question. You must start from the contract ID and then sequentially use the SearchLowerLevelComponentTool to move down each level. Note that at each level, you may use SearchLowerLevelComponentTool multiple times to explore the lower-level nodes of multiple parent nodes. If you reach the lowest level but the information is insufficient, repeat the process starting again from the highest-level node (excluding the contract node).
4. Once you have identified the three lowest-level components in step 3, use ResponseTool to determine the span of each lowest-level component.
</Search_Procedure>

Note: The tools can be used up to 10 times only.
